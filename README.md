## CS375 Repository
This repo contains Homework and Project code from my CS375 - Design & Analysis of Algorithms class at Binghamton University in Fall 2024. Primarily implemented code based on questions of the topics described below.
## Topics Included:
* Brief review of Time Complexity Analysis and how to derive time complexity
* Proving Correctness and deriving/solving Recurrence equations
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms such as Closest Pair of Points, Quicksort, Matrix Multiplication, Large Integer Multiplication, Convex-Hull
* Heap Data Structures and operations such as insert, deleteMin, percolate/siftUp, siftDown, buildHeap, and HeapSort
* Dynamic Programming (DP) concepts such as Principle of Optimality and Memoization, and DP approach of solving provlems like Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), Fibonacci Series, Binomial Coefficent, Floyd's All Pairs Shortest Path, Optimal Binary Search Tree
* Graph Theory, properties of Graphs, types of Graphs, applications of graphs, and various Graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Topological Sort, Prims MST, Kruskals MST, and Dijkstras Shortest Path
* Linear Programming concepts and applications such as the Simplex Method
* Greedy algorithms, proof of optimality
* Theory of P, NP, and NP Complete Problems, with specific examples such as 0-1 Knapsack Problem, and Traveling Salesman Problem

## Class Syllabus

Analysis of common algorithms for processing strings, trees, graphs and networks. Comparison of sorting and searching algorithms. Algorithm design strategies: divide and conquer, dynamic, greedy, back tracking, branch and bound. Introduction to NP-completeness. Required activity includes student presentations
